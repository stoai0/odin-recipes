    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Enjoy the meditative process of making your own trofie pasta and
     then savor the results once cooked and tossed with a bright and herby
     homemade pesto.</p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <h4>Pasta dough:</h4>
     <ul>
         <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
         <li>¼ cup water, or more to taste</li>
         <li>2 large eggs</li>
         <li>1 splash olive oil</li>
         <li>2 pinches of salt</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>Pesto:</h4>
     <ul>
         <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons pine nuts</li>
         <li>2 ½ cups lightly packed fresh basil</li>
         <li>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
         <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
         <li>Combine flour, 1/4 cup water, eggs, olive oil, and salt for pasta in the bowl of a food processor; 
         pulse a few times until just combined. Pinch dough to see if it sticks together and forms a small clump.
          If it's dry or crumbly, add more water, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, just until the dough forms a ball.</li>
         <li>Dump dough onto a floured surface. Knead until dough is smooth and bounces back when you poke it. 
         Wrap in plastic and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
         <li>Remove dough from the refrigerator and pull off a small chunk, about 1/2 teaspoon or smaller. 
         Place dough at the bottom of a wooden cutting board and starting with the tips or your fingers, 
         firmly roll up the board, like you are rolling the dough into a tube. Once the dough is at the base of your palm, 
         keep pressure on it and pull it back and down the board, diagonally at a 45-degree angle to create a spiral shape. 
         Repeat until all dough has been shaped.</li>
         <li>Combine garlic and pine nuts in the bowl of a food processor; process until sandy in texture. Add basil and oil 
         and process until smooth. Stir in grated Parmesan cheese until combined. Taste and add salt if needed.</li>
         <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add trofie and cook, stirring occasionally, until 
         tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
         <li>Toss cooked trofie with pesto and serve immediately.</li>
     </ol>
